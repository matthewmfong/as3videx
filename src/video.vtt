00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,770
Dr Sara Harris: OK, let's have a look at this graph and these data.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,340
The first two questions were likely the easiest, particularly if you already

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,000
have practice reading graphs.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,740
You needed to find the highest value of the people arriving curve,

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,950
and then the highest value of the people leaving curve.

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,770
20 people arrived in minute five, that's the peak value of the blue curve that

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,470
shows people arriving.

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,550
And 21 people left during minute 25, that's

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,200
the peak of the red curve that shows people leaving.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,200
So for those questions you needed to identify the highest values

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,900
on each of those curves.

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,820
You could also find the minutes at which the fewest people arrived,

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,910
which is minute 21, and at which the few people left, that's minute 8.

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,680
The third and fourth questions are harder.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,770
To answer then we have to imagine how the party changes

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,880
over time, given fluctuations in numbers of people

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,970
leaving and arriving every minute.

18
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,990
Notice that for the first 13 minutes, the numbers of people arriving

19
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,230
are always higher than the numbers of people leaving.

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,460
So we're getting more and more crowded at the party

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,930
for each of those 13 minutes.

22
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,280
The area between those two curves represents the addition

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,030
of people over that time period.

24
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,920
And then, in minute 14, more people leave than arrive.

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,160
And for the rest of the 30 minutes the party

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,170
thins out with the fewest partiers left at minute 30.

27
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,900
During each minute, between minute 14 and 30, the numbers of people leaving

28
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,760
exceeds the number of people arriving.

29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,800
Again, the area between the two curves is helpful,

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,874
it represents the net loss of people from minute 14 to minute 30.

31
00:01:40,874 --> 00:01:43,540
We don't actually know anything about what happened at the party

32
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,100
before our particular half hour, nor after,

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,230
but notice that the orange shaded region on the right

34
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,210
is larger than the blue shaded region on the left.

35
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,600
Comparing these, you can tell that there are fewer people at the party

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
at the end of the 30 minutes than there were at the beginning.

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,540
We've had a net loss of people during this half hour.

38
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,160
The purpose of this party exercise is to practice

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,919
thinking about how the balance or imbalance of flows over time,

40
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,040
in this case people coming and leaving, changes the stock.

41
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,670
It's the historical combination of stock and flow

42
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,920
that determines the state of the system at any particular time.

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,860
Let's talk more about stock.

44
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,780
A stock is the amount of something, somewhere, at some time.

45
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,870
The amount of food in your kitchen is a stock.

46
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,970
The number of bicyclists in a city, that's a stock.

47
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,290
Prisoners in prison, that's a stock, too.

48
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,370
A stock can also be something that's harder

49
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,820
to count, like water in a bucket or water in a cloud

50
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,810
or helium in a balloon.

51
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,040
Or it could be something completely intangible, like goodwill or memories

52
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,710
or influence within an organization, all of which can be gained and lost.

53
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,480
As we saw with the party, stuff flows in and out of stocks.

54
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,470
We define a flow as a rate at which stuff adds or subtracts from a stock.

55
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:08,690
Since flow is a rate, there's always an element of time included.

56
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,950
For example, we might have apples picked per hour.

57
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,290
That's the rate at which apples flow out of the stock of apples on the tree,

58
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,451
and into the stock of apples in the basket.

59
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:19,200
During the melting season in the Arctic we

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,020
can measure sea ice melted per month.

61
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,540
Other examples are, say, fish born per year,

62
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,280
or knowledge in your brain gained or lost per decade.

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,840
There are two types of flows, there's inflow and outflow.

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,970
Inflow, as the name implies, is the rate at which stuff flows in.

65
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,190
And outflow is the rate at which stuff flows out.

66
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,560
The amount of stuff in any particular stock

67
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,800
can change over time if the inflows don't match the outflows.

68
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,230
Let's take a look at a classic analogy for systems dynamics, which

69
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,870
is a bathtub.

70
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,390
We'll start with no water in the tub, so the stock is zero.

71
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,390
There's a plug in the drain, so outflow is also 0.

72
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,570
Now let's turn on the faucet.

73
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,190
As you'd expect, if you've ever prepared a bath,

74
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,370
the water level rises over time.

75
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,760
And it rises at a rate that's determined by the rate of inflow from the faucet.

76
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,790
OK, let's turn the water off.

77
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,959
The drain is still plugged, so the output is still 0.

78
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,670
And now the inflow is also 0.

79
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:26,580
Since the flows are now equal, the water level representing the stock,

80
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,220
stays constant.

81
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,690
Now let's open the drain and see what happens.

82
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,480
Inflow is still 0 because the faucet's off.

83
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,690
But now outflow is greater than zero, so the water level falls over time.

84
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,030
But let's turn the faucet back on again, before the tab completely drains.

85
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,350
If we turn the faucet on so that the rate of water flowing in

86
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,290
equals the rate of water flowing down the drain,

87
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,880
then the water level stops dropping and it stabilizes.

88
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,910
Inflow equals outflow again.

89
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,600
Only this time the flows are nonzero.

90
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,400
Let's block the drain a little bit so that inflows exceeds outflow.

91
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,270
Watch the water level rise.

92
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,910
Now let's open the drain further so that the tub is draining

93
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,600
faster than the faucet is adding water.

94
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,700
Watch the water level fall.

95
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,500
If you've ever been in the position where

96
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,330
you had to bail out a leaking boat, you have some experience

97
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,470
with the balance of inflow and outflow.

98
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,050
To summarize stock and flow with the bathtub,

99
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,350
the stock, that's the water level in this case, at any moment

100
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,480
is the result of the combined history of inflow and outflow.

101
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,350
At equilibrium, or steady state, inflow equals outflow.

102
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,120
We can have equilibrium at a wide range of different water levels,

103
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,310
but if inflow is not equal to outflow, the stock will change.

104
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,340
Now we'll take the bath tub analogy one step further

105
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,300
to get us into the world of feedbacks.

106
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,230
In a bathtub, the rate of water leaving through the drain

107
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,900
depends partly on the water level itself.

108
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,280
When the water level is lower, the tub drains more slowly.

109
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,770
Let's start with the tub about half full, at equilibrium,

110
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,830
so that inflow equals outflow.

111
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,940
Now let's crank up the faucet to double the inflow, which

112
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,600
will create an imbalance and cause the water level to rise.

113
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,690
But as the water level rises, the pressure on the drain

114
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,700
increases, so the outflow also increases,

115
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,660
slowing the water level's rate of rise.

116
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,950
What ends up happening is that the water level rises to a point

117
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,240
where the pressure on the drain causes a rate of outflow that

118
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,800
exactly matches the inflow.

119
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,050
It's a new, higher water level, but we're back at equilibrium.

120
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,650
This is an example of a feedback, in which the amount of a stock

121
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,770
influences a flow in or out of that stock.

122
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,370
And the flow, in turn, feeds back to influence the stock.

123
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,370
In this particular case, we're looking at what's

124
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,080
called a stabilizing or balancing feedback, a feedback that brings

125
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,720
the system back toward equilibrium.

126
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,190
So flow depends on stock, depends on flow.

127
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,520
Feedbacks happen when some perturbation occurs and the system responds.

128
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,140
It responds either by amplifying the perturbation,

129
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,740
pushing the system even farther in the direction of the perturbation.

130
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,040
Or the system responds to counteract the perturbation, stabilizing the system,

131
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,520
like the response of the drain coupled with the stock of water

132
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,860
brought the tub to steady state.

133
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,390
A perturbation could happen to either the stock or the flow.

134
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,760
The ramifications then feedback between the two.

135
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,540
In the climate system, you can think of feedbacks as processes

136
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,520
or a sequence of processes that both responds to temperature changes,

137
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,610
and in turn, influence temperature.

138
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,640
So they have to both respond and influence.

139
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,560
For example, imagine a glacier.

140
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,850
It's a bunch of white ice.

141
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,580
At equilibrium, the stock of ice in the glacier stays constant.

142
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,470
Some is added every year through snowfall

143
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,300
and some leaves each year through melting or calving of icebergs.

144
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,180
Imagine a perturbation in temperature that makes earth a little bit cooler.

145
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,230
With cooler temperatures the glacier might grow a little.

146
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,930
We know that clean, white ice reflects solar radiation back

147
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,330
to space pretty well.

148
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,330
It doesn't absorb a lot of incoming energy.

149
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,560
So a larger glacier would mean a larger area

150
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,880
covered with ice, which means more solar radiation reflects directly

151
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,260
back to space without being absorbed.

152
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,610
So that will cooler earths temperature a little bit more,

153
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,860
which helps the ice sheet grow bigger, which helps cool the temperature more.

154
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,830
This is an example of an amplifying feedback.

155
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,440
It's a response to a perturbation that pushes the system in the same direction

156
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,610
as the initial perturbation pushed it.

157
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,880
To generalize, if something caused global temperature to increase,

158
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,130
an amplifying feedback would increase global temperature

159
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,710
further, which would keep the feedback process going.

160
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,240
You can imagine the ice sheet in reverse as well.

161
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,090
If temperature goes up, the ice sheet will melt a little more,

162
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,370
decreasing the area covered by reflective ice, which in turn helps

163
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,840
earth warm a little bit more.

164
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,620
This is also an amplifying feedback.

165
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,830
A party can grow with feedback.

166
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,770
Maybe a small party attracts attention.

167
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,660
More people come.

168
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,890
The party attracts more attention and more people come, et cetera.

169
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,380
Let's take a look at a stabilizing feedback in the climate system.

170
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,850
The Earth itself is at some temperature and it emits energy.

171
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,060
The amount of energy objects emit depends on their temperature.

172
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,920
Warmer objects emit more energy than cooler objects.

173
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,420
So if, for some reason, the inflow of energy to earth's

174
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:41,210
surface increases, warming earth a little, as a noun warmer object,

175
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,810
earth would respond by emitting more energy than before,

176
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,230
increasing the energy outflow to match the new level of inflow.

177
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,340
By emitting more energy, it helps stabilize its temperature

178
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,980
and brings the system back toward equilibrium.

179
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,510
That equilibrium might be at a different temperature than it started with,

180
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,880
but it would be a stable new temperature until, of course,

181
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,670
the next perturbation.

182
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,210
This is similar to the bathtub, which could have many different stable water

183
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,550
levels.

184
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,650
This feedback involving radiation is actually

185
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,570
the most important stabilizing feedback in Earth's climate system.

186
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,395
To summarize stabilizing feedbacks, they're

187
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:22,100
a response to a perturbation that pushes the system in the opposite direction

188
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,110
as the initial perturbation pushed it.

189
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,800
To generalize, if something caused global temperature to increase,

190
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,890
a stabilizing feedback would respond to counteract the temperature rise, which

191
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,020
would stabilize the system, though not necessarily

192
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,760
at the original temperature.

193
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,300
Imagine that the party gets too crowded so people don't like it and they leave,

194
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,990
until the party reaches a comfortable size again and people stop leaving.

195
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,520
That would also be a stabilizing feedback.

196
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,210
Just as a side note, some of you know amplifying feedbacks

197
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:58,000
as positive feedbacks and stabilizing feedbacks as negative feedbacks.

198
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,930
That's fine if you know that terminology.

199
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,510
In this course, we'll use amplifying and stabilizing,

200
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,450
because the words positive and negative feedback have

201
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,020
everyday meanings that are different from their scientific meanings.

202
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,090
And there tends to be confusion around those terms.

203
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,070
In summary, earth's climate system has lots of different stocks,

204
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,820
lots of different flows among those stocks, and many feedback processes.

205
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,790
Some feedbacks in the climate system amplify perturbations,

206
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,000
and some feedbacks stabilize the system after a perturbation.

207
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,800
We've described two important climate feedbacks, an amplifying one involving

208
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,750
ice and reflectivity, and a stabilizing one,

209
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,900
involving earth's temperature and the amount of energy it radiates.

210
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,440
Keep your eye out for feedbacks in the world around you.

211
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,820
You'll encounter them everywhere if you look.

212
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,280
We'll examine more climate related ones later.
